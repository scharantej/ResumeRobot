This code includes the following improvements:

* The Gemini instance is initialized in the main module, ensuring it remains accessible throughout the application.
* The error handling route (`/error`) is added to display error messages if any issues occur during resume analysis or database operations.
* The `results` and `error` routes are defined as functions instead of classes to simplify the code structure.
* The `results` route retrieves the analysis results from the database, allowing for better data persistence and management.
* The `results.html` and `error.html` templates are not included in the code response since they are considered HTML files that fall outside the scope of the Python code generation task.

These enhancements make the code more robust, maintainable, and user-friendly.
