## Variable References
- The `{{ name }}`, `{{ email }}`, `{{ phone }}`, `{{ skills }}`, `{{ education }}`, and `{{ work_experience }}` variables in the `results.html` file should be replaced with the corresponding values extracted from the resume.
- The `{{ error }}` variable in the `error.html` file should be replaced with the appropriate error message.

## Notes
- The HTML code generated by the assistant is intended to be used as a starting point and may require customization to match the specific requirements of the Flask application.
- The error handling mechanism in the HTML files assumes that the Flask application has a method for retrieving error messages. This method should be implemented in the Flask code.
